// The coincidentally similar fractions of these two test cases reminds me
// of a story from Powell Observatory.  The Astronomical Society of Kansas City
// hosts frequent educational programs there, and while most are scheduled
// well in advance, the observatory and it's massive 30" Newtonian reflector
// are famous enough that there are occasional unannounced visitors.  One
// bright sunny day while some society members were performing maintenance,
// a school bus full of children pulled up.  The adults asked if there was
// any way the children could look through the telescope.  The workers didn't
// hesitate.  "Well, Venus is high in the sky right now, we could let them
// see the phase..."  The children were filed off of the bus and up the eight-
// foot warehouse ladder to take turns at the eyepiece, then right back onto
// the bus.  As the last two adults were following them up the steps of the
// bus, one was heard to grumble to the other, "I don't see why you need
// a giant telescope to look at the Moon, you can see it plain as day right
// there."  And of course he pointed to the crescent Moon in the sky, it
// looking just like Venus through the telescope.  The bus door closed and
// the bus rumbled off.
